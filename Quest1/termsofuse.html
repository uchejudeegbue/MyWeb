            <p>4. Entrants agree that by entering a prize draw their personal details may be stored and otherwise processed by Quest Online UK for the purposes of administering the selection / reward of gift voucher and for marketing and sending offers and other information.

            <p>6. The product tester / winner of each product / prize draw shall be selected at random electronically. There is no minimum or maximum number of entrants for any product / prize draw. The chances of any particular entrant winning a reward gift voucher or becoming a product tester will depend on the total number of entrants for that draw.

            <p>8 Product Testing may suspend or terminate any product or reward gift voucher at any time if it has reasonable grounds for doing so, which grounds may include without limitation a reward draw (or the website on which it is presented) being subject to, or affected by, any denial-of service attacks, bugs, viruses or any other technologically harmful material or act of hacking by a third party, or in the event of any wilful attempt to breach these terms and conditions.</p>
            <p>9. To the extent permitted by law, Product Testing, other members of our group of companies and third parties connected to Product Testing hereby expressly exclude: all conditions, warranties and other terms which might otherwise be implied by statute, common law or the law of equity; any liability for any direct, indirect or consequential loss or damage incurred by any entrant or winner in connection with any reward gift voucher or any entry.</p>
            <p>10. Product Testing is not affiliated with the manufacturer or provider of the Gift nor with any of the third parties appearing in the marketing promotional copy unless otherwise indicated.</p>
            <p>11. If you have referred a “friend” to the site via one of the refer a friend links and this “friend” is chosen to be a reviewer, this also entitles you, the “referrer”, to become a reviewer for one of the products you have applied for.

            <p>12. If chosen, both the “referrer” and the “friend” will be contacted by us via phone or email. Both parties have 7 days to claim their product/voucher.</p>
            <p>13. By referring a friend via email, social or any other means you consent that the recipient (friend) has consented to receiving emails or messages of this nature and that it is also within their best interest. This site will not be held responsible for any referral emails sent to a members friend(s). All data will only be processed for the purpose of that specific email and will not be stored or used for further marketing use.</p>
